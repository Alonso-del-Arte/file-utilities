# File Utilities

WORK IN PROGRESS

Some things that I have a need for when comparing contents of file backups. For 
example, if the folder in the source drive has 833 files and the corresponding 
folder in the backup drive has 858 files but it's not immediately clear that if 
the source folder has files that are not in the backup. It would be nice to have 
a program that can quickly scan both folders and flag such files.

Also some utilities for writing clipboard data to files and for rewriting the 
contents of a file containing ASCII control characters in which such characters 
in the original are replaced by control character "pictures" in the copy.

Java 21 with test libraries TestNG 6.14.3 and TestFrame 1.01.
