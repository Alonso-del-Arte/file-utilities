# File Utilities

WORK IN PROGRESS

Some things that I have a need for when comparing contents of file backups. For 
example, if the folder in the source drive has 833 files and the corresponding 
folder in the backup drive has 858 files but it's not immediately clear that if 
the source folder has files that are not in the backup. It would be nice to have 
a program that can quickly scan both folders and flag such files.
